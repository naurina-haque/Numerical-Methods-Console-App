# Numerical Methods console App
This repository features a collection of programs designed to solve numerical problems using widely used methods such as Bi-Section, False position, Newton Raphson, Secant, Gauss Elimination, Gauss jordan Elimination, LU Decomposition, Runge kutta method, Matrix inversion, Newton's Forwar and backward interpolation, Newton's Divided difference, Regression, Simpson's Rule, and Differential method. Each method has its own folder containing:

- The theory and description of the method
- C++ code implementation
- Sample input and output files
